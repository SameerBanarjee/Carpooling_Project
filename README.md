# Carpooling System: A Smart and Privacy-Focused Ride-Sharing Solution.
A Carpooling System enables users to share rides efficiently, reducing travel costs, congestion, and carbon footprints. This 
system connects riders and drivers securely while ensuring privacy and convenience.

# POOL CREATION & JOINING
Creating a Ride Pool (For Drivers) 
✅ Drivers can create a ride pool by entering the following details: 
✅ Pickup & Drop Locations – Exact or approximate locations for both starting and ending points. 
✅ Departure Time & Date – When the ride will begin. 
✅ Available Seats – Maximum passengers allowed. 

Process: 
1. The driver posts a new ride with all necessary details.
2. The ride becomes visible to nearby users looking for a ride. 
3. Interested riders can send a request to join. 
4. The driver can approve or reject requests based on their preferences.

Joining a Ride Pool (For Riders)
✅ Search for available ride pools based on their destination and departure time.
✅ Request to join a ride and wait for approval from the driver. 
✅ Once approved, receive ride details, including pickup location and estimated time.

Benefits: 
1. Reduces individual travel costs. 
2. Helps minimize traffic congestion. 
3. Encourages community-based carpooling.

#  INTELLIGENT RIDE MATCHING
To ensure efficiency, the system automatically matches riders with available carpools based on: 
✅ Proximity – Users are matched with ride pools starting near their location. 
✅ Route Similarity – The system finds rides that follow a similar path to the rider’s destination. 
✅ Timing & Availability – Matches only those rides that fit the user’s schedule. 

Process: 
1. The system fetches all available rides. 
2. It compares the ride’s start, destination, and route with the rider’s request. 
3. Rides are ranked based on best match scores and displayed to the user. 
4. The rider selects a suitable ride and sends a join request.


Key Advantages: 
● Optimized Ride Sharing: Minimal detours for drivers while maximizing seat occupancy. 
● Efficient Filtering: Riders see only relevant options. 
● Flexible Matching: Users can choose based on convenience and preferences.

# PRIVACY PROTECTION
As user privacy is a major concern, the personal data of users like mobile number or email id is hidden from other users while booking the same ride.
